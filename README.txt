Purview is a simple, lightweight, easily extensible validation API using Java 5 annotations. It provides full support for internationalization (i18n) and interpolation of dynamic values from validation messages using pluggable expression engines.

Purview is NOT a JSR 303 implementation and provides several features that JSR 303 does not including:

    Lots of already written validators.
    Full support for i18n with dynamic interpolation.
    Rich typing of validation problems instead of simple booleans.
    Not just for JavaBeans: Full support for validating all java language constructs including fields, classes, methods, and method parameters.

Purview is also configuration and XML free, supported by over 130 unit tests and does not require byte code modification.
